## 🧠 How It Works

The app assumes each participant in a meeting has a daily rate. Based on the meeting length and number of attendees, it estimates a range of costs for the wasted time if a decision isn’t made efficiently.

```
Hourly Rate = Daily Rate / 8
Cost = Hourly Rate × Meeting Duration × Number of Attendees
```

It plots these estimates over time so teams can track ongoing costs of indecision.
